The branches represent evolutionary distances. The shorter the branch between two viruses or organisms, the greater their genetic similarity.

For example, the Alpha variant is genetically closer to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference strain than to the Omicron variant.

**This phylogenetic tree only reflects relative relationships and genetic similarity; it does not indicate the exact direction or pathway of evolution.**
