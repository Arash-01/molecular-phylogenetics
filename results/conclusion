The branches represent evolutionary distances based on the Spike (S) gene sequences. The shorter the branch between two viruses or organisms, the greater their genetic similarity in this specific gene region.

For example, the Alpha variant is genetically closer to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference strain than to the Omicron variant.

**This phylogenetic tree only reflects relative relationships and genetic similarity; it does not indicate the exact direction or pathway of evolution.**
